In this notebook, we're going through an example machine learning project with the goal of predicting the sale price of bulldozers.

Data is not inluded in this repository (because of the files size), but can be easily downloaded from the Kaggle's Bluebook for Bulldozers competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data
There are 3 main datasets to download:
- Train.csv is the training set, which contains data through the end of 2011.
- Valid.csv is the validation set, which contains data from January 1, 2012 - April 30, 2012.
